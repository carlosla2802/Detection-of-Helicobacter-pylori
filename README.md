# Detection-of-Helicobacter-pylori

This challenge addresses the detection of Helicobacter pylori a bacterium classified since 1994 as class 1 carcinogen to humans. By its highest specificity and sensitivity, the preferred diagnosis technique is the analysis of histological images with immunohistochemical staining, a process in which certain stained antibodies bind to antigens of the biological element of interest. This analysis is a time demanding task, which is currently done by an expert pathologist that visually inspects the digitized samples.


The goal will be to apply AI techiques for the detection of HPylori in inmunohistochemical histological images
